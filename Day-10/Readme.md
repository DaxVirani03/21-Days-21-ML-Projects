This project is part of the 30 Days of Machine Learning Practice Series.
In Day 10, we continue learning by applying data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model building on a new dataset.

The notebook (10th.ipynb) contains step-by-step implementation:

Data loading and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering & preprocessing

Machine learning model training

Performance evaluation

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository or download the files.

Place the dataset in the same directory.

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook 10th.ipynb


Run all cells step by step to reproduce the results.

📊 Results

Data preprocessing and visualization completed.

Trained multiple ML models.

Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🔮 Future Work

Perform hyperparameter tuning.

Add advanced algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks).

Deploy as a Streamlit / Flask app for real-world use.
