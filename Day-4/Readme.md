Fake News Detection 📰
📌 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake based on their title, content, and metadata. Detecting fake news is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP), as misinformation spreads rapidly across online platforms.

The model uses supervised learning to analyze patterns in text and metadata and predict whether a news article is trustworthy.

📂 Dataset

Size: 20,000 rows × 7 columns

Features include:

title → News article headline

text → Main news content

date → Published date

source → News source (e.g., CNN, BBC, NY Times)

author → Author of the article

category → Category of the news (Politics, Business, Health, Technology, etc.)

Target column: label (real or fake)

⚙️ Requirements

Install the required dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk


(Optional for deep learning models):

pip install tensorflow keras torch transformers

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository or download the files.

Place the dataset in the project directory.

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook 4th.ipynb


The notebook includes:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, cleaning text).

Text vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer / Word Embeddings).

Splitting into training and test sets.

Model training (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.).

Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

📊 Results

The models are evaluated using confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes usually perform well for fake news detection.

Advanced NLP models (LSTMs, Transformers like BERT) can further improve performance.

🔮 Future Work

Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) for better text representation.

Fine-tune Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) for higher accuracy.

Build a real-time fake news detection web app using Flask or Streamlit.

Expand dataset to include social media posts (tweets, blogs, etc.).
