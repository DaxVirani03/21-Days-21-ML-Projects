Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification
📌 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either Rock or Mine. The dataset contains 60 sonar signal features per observation, with the target variable indicating:

R → Rock

M → Mine

The goal is to use supervised learning to train a model that can accurately predict whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine.

📂 Dataset

Source: Sonar Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

File: Copy of sonar data.csv

Shape: 208 rows × 61 columns

60 continuous attributes (sonar signal energy at different frequencies).

1 categorical label column (R or M).

⚙️ Requirements

Install the following dependencies before running the notebook:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository or download the files.

Place the dataset file Copy of sonar data.csv in the project directory.

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook 1st.ipynb


The notebook covers:

Data loading & preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Train-test split

Model training (classification algorithms)

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score)

📊 Results

The notebook evaluates model performance using multiple metrics.
Typical results (depending on the algorithm):

Accuracy: ~75–85%

Best Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM often perform well.

🔮 Future Work

Try deep learning models (e.g., MLP Neural Networks).

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.

Feature selection to improve performance.

Deployment of the trained model as a web app (using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit).
